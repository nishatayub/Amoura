# 🛒 E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack)  

## **Project Overview**  
This project is part of the **Kalvium Follow-Along Project: Milestone 1**. The goal of this milestone is to set up the foundation of a full-fledged e-commerce application using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).  

Through this project, we gain hands-on experience with modern full-stack web development concepts and tools.
